# Kafka-ElasticSearch-PopularUser-Twitter
A Kafka project that streams data from Twitter based on tracking terms inputted by the user. The tweet JSON objects are stored in ElasticSearch. Particular focus on "popular" users â€“ tweets from the top followed users are maintained, while tweets from "less" popular users are passed over. 

# Motivation 
Over the summer term of 2019 I was lucky to have a fantastic internship experience. I was originally placed in a data-related team, but due to the emergence of a large scale project I was subsequently shifted from it to another architecture-focused team. Before leaving, I had already sat through several team meetings and the frequent discussion about the use of Kafka piqued my interest. I figured that working on this project in my own time would give me some exposure to the data engineering / data streaming side of things that I would have gotten had I not switched teams - and I didn't know, maybe I'd return to my original team before my term was up! I wanted to be in a position where I could potentially help with anything. 

# Current Details 


# Next Steps / Improvements 
At the moment this project is pretty much a purely backend-implemented project. What I have in mind for future iterations would be to create a nice dashboard where I can display all of these stored tweets, full with CSS animations and a generally aesthetic look. It would be a chance for me to learn more about web frontend too since I can't honestly say that I have experienced this to a sufficient level as of now. I currently only have some basic experience with React.
